What are checksums and what are they useful for?
Checksums are used for verification and to check data for errors.
Checksums are created using an algorithm, usually MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256. Others can be used.
They are useful to help verify code or data if it has been altered.
Any piece of data can be run through an algorithm to get a checksum, which will be given a unique string of letters and numbers.
Using a checksum will help determine that the code is correct and without errors from its source.
